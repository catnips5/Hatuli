# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep this project secure!  
If you discover a vulnerability or have a security concern, **please follow the steps below instead of opening a public issue.**

## 🔒 Supported Versions
| Version | Supported? |
|---------|------------|
| `main` (branch) | ✅ |
| older tags | ❌ |

> *This is a static site built with plain HTML / CSS / JS.
> No server-side code or user data is stored, so the attack surface is minimal.*

## 📝 Reporting a Vulnerability
1. **Privately contact the maintainer:**  
   <tal.semenov97"gmail.com>  
   *(replace with your real address or an alias).*
2. Include:
   - Detailed description of the issue  
   - Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if possible)  
   - Your expectations / suggested fix

I will **acknowledge receipt within 48 hours** and provide a timeline for a fix.  
Public disclosure will occur **only after** a patch is released or we agree it is no longer a security risk.

## 🔧 Remediation Process
| Phase | Typical Timeframe |
|-------|------------------|
| Triage & confirmation | ≤ 2 days |
| Fix development | ≤ 7 days (simple static-site changes are often faster) |
| Release & notification | Immediately after merge |
